9/23   9:00pm  3:00  read assignment and played several games to help me understand the rules
9/24   1:00am  1:00  wrote pseudo code and went through the data flow in the algorithm
9/24   2:00am  2:00  start to implemenet helper methods
9/24   11:00am 1:30  finish implementing player 2's methods
9/24   5:00pm  2:00  optimize the running time by initializing maps to avoid redundant calculation
9/24   7:00pm  5:00  finish implementing player 1's methods, testing with the given tests, and implementing user input part

               15:00  TOTAL time spent
			   10:00  TOTAL time estimated
Major Difficulties:
1) Understand the math formula of win rate for player 1 and player 2
2) Implement the math formula in the code
3) Keep the running time under 5 seconds
