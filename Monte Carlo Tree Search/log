10/26 7:00pm   2:00  read assignment and played several games to help me understand the rules.
10/26 9:00am   5:00  finished the program (first try) and got over 50% of win rate with 1000 iterations
10/27 1:00pm   3:00  debugged and got over 70% of win rate with 10000 iterations

               10:00  TOTAL time spent
			   10:00   TOTAL time estimated
Major Difficulties:
1) Not familar with python! I am a Java user so this assignment is harder
2) Struggled A LOT to figure out how to make the win rate optimal
