##### Problem 1
Alpha-Go, a computer program that plays the board game Go, was developed by Google DeepMind. Standard Go board has 19x19 grids of lines, containing 361 points, significantly more complicated than Chess. The naive algorithm such as table-driven algorithm could not predict more than several steps due to the large amount of possible move. A proficient Go player will normally predict more than 10 steps with a macro perspective of the board. At 2017, Alpha-Go beat Jie Ke, the best Go player in the world by the time. 

Alpha-Go's algorithm combines machine learning and tree search techniques, with extensive training from both human and computer play.[1] It uses Monte Carlo tree search, guided by a "value network" and a "policy network," both implemented using deep neural network technology.[2] A few special cases, nakada pattern (well-studied moves in some special situations) will be placed. Like reflex agenets, once nakada pattern is detected, the move will be made without sending to neural network.[2]

The system was initially trained to mimic human play by attempting to match the moves of expert players from recorded historical games, using a database of around 30 million moves.[3] Once it had reached a certain degree of proficiency, it was trained further by being set to play large numbers of games against other instances of itself, using reinforcement learning to improve its play.[1]

##### Problem 2
 | Agent Type | Performance Measure | Environment | Actuators | Sensors |
 | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
 | Shopping for used AI books on the Internet | Price, Book Quality (Customer Rate, Book Condition) | Websites for Book Rental | Programs that place the book rental order in the websites | Programs that collect the price, customer rates, and other relevant information from the book rental websites | 
 | Bidding on an item at an auction | Purchased Price and Revenue (Compared to market value) if win a bid, Potential Gain/Loss (Compared to market value) if lose a bid, Hit/Miss Rate (if a bid is profittable in the final bidding price, do we get the item?) | Websites for Auction, Other Online Bidders if the auction is online; Auctioneers, Other Bidders, Auction Hall if the auction happens in the real life | Speaker/Display/Jointed Arm and Hand to announce the bidding price, Programs that enter bidding price in the website | Perception of Voice or Display of bidding price by other bidders (Voice/Image Sensor or Programs that monitor bids) | 

For the scenerio of shopping for used AI books on the Internet, the environment (Websites for Book Rental) is represented as a HashMap, whose keys are names of the websites in the form of String and corresponding values are HashMaps (Whose keys are names of the books in the form of String, and corresponding values are Books. Book is a class that contains all the information about the book, including price, customer rate, and book condition.) The performance could be evaluated, based on all the stored information, by modeling all the factors of rental book quality into a score. The score will provide insight for the performance evaluation of program output.

For the scenerio of bidding on an item at an aution, the environment is represented as a HashMap, whose keys are the names/ids of the bidders and the corresponding values are Bid. Bid is a class that contains the current highest bidding price, a list of bidding history, and the bids' time. The performance could be evaluated, based on the final bidding price and market price/profittable price of the item, that 1) if a bid is won, the AI's price is higher or lower compared to the market price/profittable price, 2) if a bid is not won, if the final price is higher or lower compared to the market price/profittable price, 3) if the AI participates in multiple auditions, what is the rate of hit (bid won when the final price is profittable) or the rate of miss (bid not won when the final price is profittable).
